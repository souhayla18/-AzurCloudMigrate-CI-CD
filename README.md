## Key Insights

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### 3.1. Data Ingestion

Our journey begins as we connect the on-premise PostgreSQL database with Azure using the mystical Microsoft Integration Runtime. With a flick of our wand, we set up a resource group adorned with essential services like the Key Vault, Storage Account, Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics. The tables gracefully migrate from the on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, ready to embark on their azure adventure.

### 3.2. Data Transformation

Mounting Azure Blob Storage to Databricks, we retrieve raw data from the azure depths of the Data Lake. With the power of the Spark Cluster in Azure Databricks, we embark on an enchanting journey of data cleaning and refinement. The cleaned data finds its sanctuary in the Delta format, optimized for further azure analysis.

### 3.3. Data Loading

Azure Synapse Analytics becomes our sacred ground for loading the refined data efficiently. Here, we create SQL databases and forge azure connections with the azure waters, ready to dive into azure insights.

### 3.4. Data Reporting

With the Azure Synapse as our guide, we connect Microsoft Power BI for  data visualizations, using the Views of the DB.
